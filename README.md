# Bike Sharing Analysis

## Overview
####
A tenative bike-sharing program has been proprosed to investors and stakeholders for the city of Des Moines based off of the success of a similar bike-sharing program in New York City. In order to provide a credible and feasible business plan, the stakeholders have requested a break down of the bike share data in New York City. Before beginning the process of creating helpful imagery, the CSV file containing the bike share data is accessed using Python code, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook. With these different tools, the CSV file is placed into a dataframe, the trip duration field converted to the appropriate datetime type, and then saved to a new CSV file. With the corrected data, several useful graphs and visualizations are then created using Tableau Public to fulfill the requests of the potential investors.

## Summary
### Suggestions for Business Planning
####
success in nyc is seen with male subscribers. des moines can follow this path of pushing for male subscribers in order to achieve similar success. would be a good idea to station these bikes around populated work and home destinations to match the commute data being seen in nyc. also some proof that younger individuals are going longer distances on bikes. all important factors that could benefit des moines planning.
### Suggestions for Future Analysis
####
have data on male vs female, but not age. know that men are the primary users, so breaking down weekday trips by age rather than gender could tell you who to market for (explain which graph type to use). continuing on the focus of age groups, could create a pie chart for birth years rather than by gender. both of these factors could provide the bike share company insight into their potential market for further success.
